# Work Day Scheduler Finished Code
-- Note, In order for me to be able to get the page to load properly all HTML, CSS, JAVA must be at the top of the directory--

In the project we were to use our new knowledge of java, bootstraps and JQuery to make a work day calender</br>
Be able to edit and save tasks into local storage</br>
Color code past times, present time, and future time.</br>
Must include all business hours, being 9am-5pm. However I included 6pm to make sure that future time was colored accordingly.</br>
